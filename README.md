# Farcater - Hello World

A lightweight, responsive web app built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that lets users sign in using their Farcaster account via the official @farcaster/auth-kit. Once authenticated, it displays key profile details — including FID, username, display name, avatar, bio, and primary Ethereum wallet address — all without any backend or data persistence. Designed for quick deployment on Vercel and discoverability as a Farcaster Mini App inside Warpcast.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
